### Google Analytics

It is possible to track your site statistics through [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/). Similar to Disqus, you will have to create an account for Google Analytics, and enter the correct Google ID for your site under `google-ID` in the `settings.yml` file. More information on [how to set up Google Analytics](https://michaelsoolee.com/google-analytics-jekyll/). Note: If you are not using Google Analytics, please change `google-ID` to an empty string.

### RSS Feeds

Atom is supported by default through [jekyll-feed](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed). With jekyll-feed, you can set configuration variables such as 'title', 'description', and 'author', in the `_config.yml` file.

RSS 2.0 is also supported through [RSS auto-discovery](http://www.rssboard.org/rss-autodiscovery). The `rss-feed.xml` file (based on the template found at [jekyll-rss-feeds](https://github.com/snaptortoise/jekyll-rss-feeds)) that the feed path points to when using RSS 2.0 is automatically generated based on the appropriate configuration variables found in `_data/settings.yml`.

To use RSS 2.0, ensure the following is done:

* Uncomment the last two lines in the `_config.yml` file.

* In `_data/settings.yml`, under 'social', comment out the rss-square that points to `feed.xml`, and uncomment the rss-square that points to `rss-feed.xml`.

* In `_includes/head.html`, comment out `{% feed_meta %}` and uncomment the line under the RSS 2.0 comment.
