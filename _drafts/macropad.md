SU120 appears to be an extremely flexible PCB for unleashing our 
creativity in terms of mechanical keyboard crafting. Here I will 
quickly summarize the steps I followed to build a very basic
macropad, just scratching the surface of what seems to be possible.

I got the necessary components from [TALP](https://talpkeyboard.stores.jp/), 
which included the SU120 PCB, a Pro Micro, diodes, Kaih PCB sockets, a rotary 
encoder and a tact switch button.

The first step is to solder the diodes.

Try to blend them in a uniform way.

The black mark of the diode needs to be aligned to the diagram in the PCB.

Add some tape to fix them before soldering.

Solder them and cut (here they are still long, as I didnt know how much you could go).

Next, we solder the Kaih sockets. These will allow to make the PCB hot swappable so we 
can replace the switches more easlily.

When soldering, try to keep it as aligned as possible, otherwise it will impact onthe arragement
of the switches.

Next,the tact switch button, which will be used as reset button for the PCB. No much to do here.

Almost there, the Pro Micro.

The rotary encoder has its own position, and can be soldered in the same way a normal switch

Now the switches. For this one, I combined some Creams with Gateron reds

And finally some keycaps

To protect the PCB, you can put some rubber feet

Or, like in my case, make a quick wooden case
